# Publishing Wall Clock Card on HACS

## Changes Made

To prepare the Wall Clock Card for publication on HACS (Home Assistant Community Store), the following changes have been made:

1. Created `hacs.json` file with the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Wall Clock Card",
     "content_in_root": false,
     "filename": "wall-clock-card.js",
     "render_readme": true,
     "homeassistant": "0.118.0"
   }
   ```

2. Created `CHANGELOG.md` file to document the changes in each release, starting with version 1.0.0.

3. Created `HACS_SUBMISSION.md` with detailed instructions on how to submit the repository to HACS.

4. Verified that the repository structure meets HACS requirements:
   - The main JavaScript file (wall-clock-card.js) is in the dist directory
   - The README.md file is comprehensive and well-formatted
   - The repository has a valid license (MIT)

5. Tested the build to ensure everything works correctly.

## Next Steps

To complete the publication process, you need to:

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository.

2. Create a release on GitHub:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Releases" on the right side
   - Click on "Create a new release"
   - Enter the tag version (e.g., v1.0.0)
   - Enter the release title (e.g., "Initial Release")
   - Copy the content from CHANGELOG.md for this version
   - Click "Publish release"

3. Follow the submission process outlined in HACS_SUBMISSION.md to submit your repository to HACS.

## Conclusion

Your Wall Clock Card is now ready to be published on HACS. Once approved, it will be available for all Home Assistant users to install through the HACS interface.
